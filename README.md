# Kafka-Test

1. Kafka-Producer: This code creates a Kafka producer that sends a message with the key "message-key" and the value "Hello, Kafka!" to the "messages" topic. The producer is configured using a dictionary of configuration options that specify the connection details for the Kafka server.

2. Kafka-Consumer: This code creates a Kafka consumer that subscribes to the "messages" topic and consumes all messages that are published to that topic. The consumer is configured using a dictionary of configuration options that specify the connection details for the Kafka server and the group ID for the consumer.

3. To run this code, you will need to have a Kafka server running on your local machine. You can follow the instructions in the Kafka documentation to set up a local Kafka server.
